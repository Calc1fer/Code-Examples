# Code Examples
 Examples of my code
Note: This is a selection of code samples which showcase some work I have done over the years during study and professional projects.

MLAgents Code Samples:
I created a mini game similar to fall guys where the player races an agent through an obstacle course. The agent is designed to become more challenging if the player wins. It is an attempt at a basic showcase of dynamic difficulty adjustment. (written in C#, Unity)


Emotion Recognition Technology Code Samples:
I wrote code that would allow an agent to analyse and learn from a database of images pertaining to human emotions. The task was to create something where once the agent had trained on data, it could be presented unseen data to determine it's efficacy at identifying the portrayed human emotion. The data was head on mugshots of animated characters showcasing varying emotions. (written in Python)


Professional Project:
As part of third year in uni, we were paired with an industry partner to create an educational prototype teaching a global audience about medieval Islamic history. We created a vertical slice which allowed for exploration and discovery of artefacts. These code snippets are some of the areas I worked on including the player controller, animations, and UI.

AR Project:
As part of an AR project, I used Unreal Engine 5 as per the project brief to create a simple AR experience on android phones. The user could destroy towers by throwing projectiles while avoiding small tic tac objects firing at the player. The player could also throw bombs at the structures which required the user to blow into the microphone to spark or put out the bombs. The code snippets here showcase the audio capture methods, how to access blueprints in code, and general code structure. (written in C++, Unreal Engine 5)


Audio Project:
I created a mini game that allows the user to explore a void relying mainly on sound and guides they can drop to mark their path. This project was a way to explore how audio is implemented in games. These samples showcase how different audio techniques can be implemented such as low pass filters, spatial audio, and attenuation. A walkthrough of the game can be found here:

Procedural Level Building Tool:
For my honours I focused heavily on the idea of creating that tool that could potentially increase productivity in level design while maintaining high quality design. This is aimed at smaller development teams so designers and artists can focus more on the granular detail of their game worlds. This tool has shown that it can increase the speed and potentially the creativity of designers.
The code samples here showcase some editor window customisation, connector gizmos which are the basis for the objects in the game space to be connected together, and also a portion of the base algorithm for joining objects together. Essentially a giant jigsaw is created based on user defined rules using a procedural approach.
A showcase example of the tool using different world aesthetics is available here to watch:

Game Mechanic Project:
This project focused on implementing a game mechanic, in this case an ice ball throwing ability which damages enemies. It was created in Unreal Engine 5. The project showcases clean code, an implementation of animations and an 8-directional movement system. A good demonstration of what this project does can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/fxS9TrClyIk (written in C++)
